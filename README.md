Atlas-GRAG lets you explore hidden risks in supply chains using smart graph analysis. This tool finds connections that others miss. It is made to help people understand complex risks without needing coding skills.

---

## 📘 What is atlas-grag?

Atlas-GRAG is a system that combines two methods: Knowledge Graphs and Vector Search. It looks for links between different pieces of data. This helps uncover risks that standard methods can miss. It works by tracing paths through the data, spotting hidden problems that build on each other.

If you work with supply chains or risk analysis, atlas-grag can help you see the full risk chain clearly.

## 🛠️ How atlas-grag Works

Atlas-grag uses something called "Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation." This means it takes in data about your supply chain and turns it into a web of connected items, like suppliers, products, and transports. Then it searches through this web to find chains of risks that could affect your operations.

It does this in steps:

1. **Ingest Data:** Atlas-grag loads your supply chain data into a graph.
2. **Vector Search:** It turns complex information into searchable data points.
3. **Multi-hop Reasoning:** The system traces through multiple links to find hidden risks.
4. **Results:** The app shows you a visual map of risks and dependencies.
